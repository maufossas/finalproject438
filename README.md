## Movie App

The app uses the TheMovieDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) to access movies from online, and uses Firebase to store user information as well as movie ratings and reviews. Users can see what movies have been trending over the past day, or search movies by title, release year, language, and ratings. When they tap on a movie, they can see the movie's description and choose to add it to their watchlist, see reviews that other users have written, or write a review of their own. Users can also select up to 3 movies as favorites on their profile, as well as see which movies they have written reviews for and a short list of their recent activity.
